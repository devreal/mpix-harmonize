# mpix-harmonize

Experimental MPI function to synchronize processes in the space and time dimension

# Installation

## Basic Build
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .
make
```

## Specific Target
If you want to install the library into a specific target folder, use
```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<YOUR_PATH> .
```

## Time Source
The internal clock sychnronization depends on the time source used internally.
By default, the library will use `MPI_Wtime` as its source of time. Then, the library uses the timing function that is provided by the MPI library, which may be mapped to different kernel functions internally.

The `libmpix-harmonize` library can also be configured to use a specific time function internally. Thusm, in order to use `clock_gettime()` with `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` configure with
```sh
cmake -DMPITS_CLOCK=monotonic .
```
and to use `clock_gettime()` with `CLOCK_REALTIME` configure like this
```sh
cmake -DMPITS_CLOCK=realtime .
```
